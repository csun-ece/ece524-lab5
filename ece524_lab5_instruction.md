# Lab 5 - Arithmetic

## Objective

After completing this lab, students will be able to:
- Decomposing a digital system to datapath and control path
- Implement a digital computer arithmetic system
- Interface with different PMOD modules including switches, LEDs, push buttons, and seven segments


## Requirements

The following material is required to complete the lab:
- Xilinx Vivado 2019.1

## Introduction

In this lab you are going to implement one of the arithmetic circuits that is covered in the class. Write VHDL code to implement the circuit as well as simulation testbench to verify its functionality. The options are:

1. 16-bit unsigned multiplier (Right shift algorithm)
2. 16-bit unsigned multiplier (Left shift algorithm)
3. 32/48/64-bit high radix multiplier (Radix 4/8/16)
4. Parameterized Array Multiplier
5. 16-bit unsigned restoring divider
6. 16-bit unsigned nonrestoring divider
7. A relatively complex arithmetic circuit of your own!!

Note: You can volunteer for option (7) or if you decide to go with options (1) through (6), the arithmetic circuit will be assigned to you by the instructor (randomly).

:point_right: **Task 1:** Provide the detailed block diagram of your design.

:point_right: **Task 2:** Provide VHDL source code and VHDL testbench for the design.

:question: **Question 1:** Provide FPGA area utilization for your deisgn.
